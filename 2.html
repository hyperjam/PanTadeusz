<title>Book Two: The Castle<br></title>
</head>

<body> Thus in this world fate all with a bell's tolling ends,
Great ambitions, great projects of imagination,
Childhood's playtimes and friendship's heart-felt consolations,
The hearts' tender confessions! Should some dread bronze roar
From afar, all is shattered, confused – is no more!   <br></body>
